                        <p>The concept of states represents a unique and powerful quality of the web as a medium: the ability to change content and form over time with input from a user. Websites are not static, instead they are ever changing.</p>
                        <p>Through this assignment I chose to explore the changing states of place. The central focus relies upon user input/intercation to “change between places” which inadvertently affect other components of the User Interface: color, type, contrast, visibility, etc.</p>
                        <ol>
                            <li>Click on any of the dots across the map to reveal the poster of that location.</li>
                            <li>Click on the poster to see the reference image for the poster.</li>
                            <li>Click back on the dot to close the poster. If the poster is in the way, simply drag it out of the way!</li>
                            <li>To see a full view of all the posters at once, navigate to the grid view.</li>
                        </ol>
                        <p>This site was inspired by a series of posters I had made inspired by my travels around the world. It stands to keep them alive for anyone to see.</p>

                        <p>One way to think about tools is through the lens of inputs and outputs. A tool is a mediator between human input and physical, visual, or conceptual output, and will have a significant impact on what type of output is created. A hammer for instance, takes human energy as input and amplifies force to achieve desired results. Hammers allow us to bang nails into walls.</p>
                        <p>Through this tool I was hopping to challenge myself and explore a complex mathematical problem through an artistic lense. The tool uses p5.js library to imitate the offset algorithm  by calculating distance from each pixel to an array of points.</p>
                        <p>Although not entirely complex, feel free to manipulate the pixels, colors and points on the screen by using the panel on the right. If you want to add more points, just click anywhere on the canvas. </p>
                        <p>And don't forget to save your designs!</p>

                        <p>API's are the wheels of the web. They contain all the data we could ever imagine. With this project I wanted to visually depict the contrasting effects of travel through data.</p>
                        <p>On the one hand, there is a data visualization of organic shaped drops, uniquely placed as a response to the inputted destinations. It gives the user the ability to visually depict a year of travels and save their visualization.</p>
                        <p>On the other hand, all of those travels also garner a humongous weight of CO2 emissions that we often don't consider when traveling.</p>
                        <p>Type in the airport codes of all the airports you have visited throughout one year of travels. Make sure they are Capitalized! And what the visualization come to life.</p>
